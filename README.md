### Download v1.0 for Windows [here](https://github.com/jj4giya/ity/raw/main/ITY.exe)
### Download v1.0 for Mac [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jj4giya/ity/main/ITY.dmg)
<h3 align="center">PLEASE READ THE STEPS BELOW ATLEAST</h2>

#### Important checks before clicking on the software:

0. Check that you're on WiFi since downloading your data MIGHT take a lot of Internet
1. Reset your password if you don't remember it
2. Follow the steps before clicking on the EXE file

:warning: This software has been tested on Windows 10 and Mac Monterey and **not on Microsoft Store version/ Android emulator**

### Features:

- Gives you a list of users who are not following you back
- Does not require you to login via the software so it is 100% safe and will not get you banned/ make you change password
- Open source so it is transparent that I'm not stealing your data 
- List can be transferred to a mobile device too for unfollowing, whichever feels more efficient
- Plug and play once you download your Instagram data

### Steps:

#### 1. Downloading your Instagram data.
- Login to your [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) account on any browser.
- Go to your profile page and click on the **"Settings"** button

- Click on **"Privacy and Security"** and go to **"Data Download"**
- **(IMPORTANT)** Enter any email of yours and Request download in HTML 

You should get a mail within an hour with a link to download your Instagram data. Download it and go to the next step.
If you have a lot of data, sometimes Instagram breaks it into parts. My following and followers folder was in part 1 so only download that.

#### 2. Running the program.
- Open the downloaded ZIP file (your IG data)
- From the **followers_and_following** folder, extract **followers.html** and **following.html**
- Run the ITY.exe file. 

#### 3. Pay them back.
- Click on the username to get redirected to their Instagram page to unfollow them.
- You can also transfer the **ITY.html** file to your mobile phone for ease of access.
:warning: Please do note that Instagram will lock your account if you unfollow too many people at once. (Thanks Zucc)
<p> There is an approximate limit of unfollowing 150-200 people per day 
  
### Uninstall:

- Just delete the ITY.exe/ITY.dmg file and html files if you don't require them anymore

### DISCLAIMER

- Please follow all the steps carefully
- As of now, there is no way to quicken the process (Drawback of not logging in)
- The HTML is not realtime, to update the list you need to download your data from Instagram again.
- I do not own a Mac so I had to make the Mac version on a Virtual Machine. If there is a bug, I will do my best to fix it ASAP.

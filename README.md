## Prerequisites

- Check that you're on WiFi since downloading your data MIGHT take a lot of Internet
- Reset your password if you don't remember it, you need it while downloading your data
- PLEASE download your IG data first before running the software

:warning: This software has been tested on Windows 10 and Mac Ventura ONLY

## Features

- Gives you a list of users who are not following you back
- Does not require you to login via the software so it is 100% safe and will not get you banned/ make you change password
- List can be transferred to a mobile device too for unfollowing, whichever feels more efficient
- Plug and play once you download your Instagram data

## Steps

### Downloading Your Instagram Data

1. Login to your [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) account on any browser.
2. Click on ≡**More** and go to **Settings**

</p>

9. You can now request for your data.

You should get a mail within a few minutes with a link to download your Instagram data. Download it and go to the next step. If you have a lot of data, sometimes Instagram breaks it into parts. My following and followers folder was in part 1 so only download that.

### Running the Program

1. Open the downloaded ZIP file (your IG data)
2. From the **followers_and_following** folder, extract **followers.html** and **following.html** to your preferred location.

Mac users please follow the steps from : [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jj4giya/status/1619604566248673281?s=20) or [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/i3uUeFq)

For Windows, just run ITY.exe 

### Pay Them Back

1. Click on the username to get redirected to their Instagram page to unfollow them.
2. You can also transfer the **ITY.html** file to your mobile phone for ease of access.

:warning: Please do note that Instagram will lock your account if you unfollow too many people at once. (Thanks Zucc)
Instagram starts to stop me after unfollowing 20-30+ accounts continuously. It is recommended not to unfollow more than 100 accounts a day.

## Uninstall

- Just delete the ITY.exe/ITY.dmg file and html files if you don't require them anymore

## Disclaimer

- Only download from the link on my GitHub or Discord. I am not responsible if you download it from elsewhere.
- Please follow all the steps carefully, but I am always there to help!
- As of now, there is no way to quicken the process (Drawback of not logging in)
- The HTML is not realtime, to update the list you need to download your data from Instagram again.
- I do not own a Mac so I had to make the Mac version on a Virtual Machine. If there is a bug, I will do my best to fix it ASAP.
